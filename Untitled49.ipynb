    "A database is a structured collection of data that is organized, stored, and managed in a way that allows for efficient retrieval, updating, and analysis of the data. It provides a systematic way to store and retrieve information.\n",

    "SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL (Not Only SQL) are two different types of database management systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "SQL databases are based on the relational model and use structured query language (SQL) for defining and manipulating the data. They organize data into tables with predefined schemas, where each table represents an entity or a relationship. SQL databases ensure data integrity through ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties and are suitable for complex queries and transactions. Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, and Microsoft SQL Server.\n",
    "\n",
    "NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are designed to handle unstructured, semi-structured, or structured data and provide flexible schemas. They are often used for handling large-scale, distributed, and real-time data. NoSQL databases can be categorized into different types, such as document databases, key-value stores, columnar databases, and graph databases. Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Redis, and Neo4j.\n",

    "Primary Key: A primary key is a column or a set of columns in a table that uniquely identifies each row or record. It ensures the uniqueness and integrity of the data within a table. Primary keys enforce entity integrity and are used as a reference for establishing relationships with other tables. In most databases, primary keys are defined as non-null and automatically indexed for faster access. For example, in an \"employees\" table, the \"id\" column can be defined as the primary key.\n",
    "Foreign Key: A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in a table that establishes a link or a relationship between two tables. It refers to the primary key of another table, creating a parent-child relationship between the tables. Foreign keys enforce referential integrity and help maintain consistency in the data. They ensure that the values in the foreign key column(s) exist in the referenced table's primary key column(s). For example, in an \"orders\" table, a foreign key column \"customer_id\" can reference the primary key column \"id\" in a \"customers\" table, indicating which customer placed the order."
